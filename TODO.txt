Semantic
--------
[ ] Function call inside an expression is supported only if the function returns a single value
[ ] Maximum of x values may be returned from a function
[ ] Only one Bot may be defined per program
[ ] Number of arguments passed = Number of arguments in function header
[ ] Number of variables on LHS = Number of return values from function
[ ] Identifiers that serve to indicate the names in named parameter of a function call do not have to be declared
[ ] An identifier can not be declared multiple times within the same scope. However, if it is declared in both a given block and, say its ancestor block, the ancestor block's variable will be hidden.
[ ] No identifier may have the same name as a fucntion that has been declared, irrespective of where the identifier is to be declared
[ ] Function overloading is not allowed
[ ] Recursive function calls are not allowed
[ ] No function may call another function, except for the main() function
[X] All variables must be declared before use, in the same block, the parent block or in an ancestor block

Type checking
-------------
[ ] The program follows static typing, i.e., the type of a variable has to be declared in advance, and may not change till the end of the variable's lifetime
[ ] Point
[ ] Bot
[ ] Array
[ ] Widening conversion (coercion) is supported only from an integer to a float. More specifically, if X is an expression of the form E1 <op> E2, where E1 and E2 are expressions, or if X is an assignment statement of the form <type> ID = E3, where E3 is an expression, the coercion happens as follows:
	[ ] If E1 and E2 evaluate to floats, integers or booleans, and <op> is a relational operator, X is a boolean
	[ ] If both E1 and E2 evaluate to floats, and <op> is an arithmetic operator, X is a float
	[ ] If both E1 and E2 evaluate to integers, and <op> is an arithmetic operator X is a integer
	[ ] If either E1 or E2 is a float, the other is an integer, and <op> is an arithmetic operator, X is a float
	[ ] If either E1 or E2 is a boolean, and <op> is an arithmetic operator, an error is flagged
	[ ] If either E1 or E2 is a Point or an array, an error is flagged. However, a single array element is treated exactly like an element of the type ot which the element belongs
[ ] Conversions
	[ ] Narrowing conversion from a floating point value to an integer is supported via type-casting, 
		for example, 
			int x = (int) 23.823; 
		is a valid statement, and a value of 23 is stored in x. Note that no rounding happens.
	[ ] Conversions are not supported from or to the boolean type
	[ ] Conversions are not supported from or to the Point datatype
	[ ] Conversions from or to entire arrays are not supported, and an array of one type cannot be interconverted to an array of another type. However, a single array element is treated exactly like an element of the type ot which the element belongs
[ ] Function calls
	[ ] Coercion is not supported when passing arguments to a function
	[ ] Coercion is supported when a function returns a value, and this value is used in an expresison or is assigned
	[ ] Coercion is not supported when a function returns multiple values
	[ ] Narrowing conversions, according to the rules specified in 8, are supported when passing an argument as input to a function
	[ ] Narrowing conversions, according to the rules specified in 8, are permitted when a function has a single return value
	[ ] Narrowing conversions are not permitted when there are multiple values returned from a function
[ ] If statements and the conditional part of for loops may have only boolean types, or expressions that give rise to boolean types.
[X] RNUM is of type float
[X] NUM is of type integer
[X] <bool> represents a boolean type, and may take either a TRUE or a FALSE value
