1. Function call inside an expression is supported only if the function returns a single value
2. Maximum of x values may be returned from a function (x=5)
3. Maximum of y arguments may be passed to a function (y=5)
4. Only one Bot may be defined per program
5. Number of arguments passed = Number of arguments in function header
6. Number of variables on LHS = Number of return values from function
7. Number of return arguments from a function = Number specified in header, and the corresponding types match exactly
8. All variables must be declared before use, in the same block, the parent block or in an ancestor block
9. An identifier can not be declared multiple times within the same scope. However, if it is declared in both a given block and, say its ancestor block, the ancestor block's variable will be hidden.
10. No identifier may have the same name as a function that has been declared, irrespective of where the identifier is to be declared
11. Function overloading is not allowed
12. Recursive function calls are not allowed
